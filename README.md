### What does Azrael mean to me?

The name Azrael, representing both an end and a transition, inherently embraces the existential concept that awareness of mortality enhances vitality. This dual awareness upbrings a heightened appreciation for life's wonderful moments and encourages a more engaged and passionate approach to living. It's a conscious decision to live fully, with an understanding of life's finite nature, driving a pursuit for meaningful experiences and authentic relationships.

Existentialism places great emphasis on freedom ‚Äì the freedom to choose, to create oneself, and to determine one‚Äôs path. Yet, this freedom comes with the weight of responsibility. By choosing the name Azrael, there is an acknowledgment of this dialectic. It symbolizes a freedom to embody values of compassion and understanding, coupled with the responsibility to act in accordance with these values, especially in moments that matter most. It reflects a commitment to make choices that are not only personally fulfilling but also contribute positively to the lives of others.

Azrael as a character often embodies paradoxes ‚Äì being both feared and honored, a symbol of both end and transition. Similarly, existentialism is riddled with paradoxes: the pursuit of meaning in a potentially meaningless universe, the loneliness of individual existence alongside the need for connection, and the desire for freedom tempered by the burden of choice. Embracing the name Azrael is to embrace these paradoxes, to live comfortably within them, and to find personal truth amidst these seemingly contradictory aspects of existence.

Existentialism highlights that authenticity is achieved through a continuous process of self-discovery and personal evolution. In this light, Azrael is not just a static symbol but a dynamic representation of ongoing growth and transformation. It reflects a dedication to exploring and understanding the depths of one's own existence and the world at large, constantly evolving and adapting in the pursuit of a genuine and meaningful life.

While Azrael represents a deeply personal choice, it also resonates with universal themes of life, death, and the human experience. This interplay between individuality and universality is a cornerstone of existential thought. The personal journey mirrored in the name Azrael highlights the universal quest for understanding, purpose, and connection in a world that is often complex and challenging.

Naming myself Azrael is more than a symbolic gesture; it is a profound commitment to a life lived with depth, authenticity, and an open embrace of existential realities. It signifies a journey that is constantly evolving, reflecting both the personal nuances of individual existence and the broader human condition. This choice is a testament to the courage to confront life's greatest questions and the determination to find meaning and purpose within them.
