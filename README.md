### 💾 Code Snippets 

I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different tools. Here are some of my favorite code snippets.

### The Meaning Behind 'Azrael'

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/Batman.gif" width=4096 alt="Moon" />
</p>

The name **Azrael**, representing both an end and a transition, inherently embraces the existential concept that _awareness of mortality enhances vitality_. This dual awareness upbrings a _heightened appreciation_ for life's wonderful moments and encourages a more engaged and passionate approach to living. It's a _conscious decision_ to live fully, with an understanding of _life's finite nature_, driving a pursuit for _meaningful experiences_ and _authentic relationships_.

_Existentialism_ places great emphasis on _freedom_ – the _freedom to choose_, to create oneself, and to determine one’s path. Yet, this freedom comes with the weight of _responsibility_. By choosing the name **Azrael**, there is an acknowledgment of this dialectic. It symbolizes a freedom to embody values of _compassion and understanding_, coupled with the _responsibility_ to act in accordance with these values, especially in moments that matter most. It reflects a commitment to make choices that are not only personally fulfilling but also contribute positively to the lives of others.

**Azrael** as a character often embodies paradoxes – being both feared and honored, a symbol of both end and transition. Similarly, _existentialism_ is riddled with paradoxes: the pursuit of meaning in a potentially meaningless universe, the loneliness of _individual existence_ alongside the need for connection, and the desire for freedom tempered by the burden of choice. Embracing the name **Azrael** is to embrace these paradoxes, to live comfortably within them, and to find _personal truth_ amidst these seemingly contradictory aspects of existence.

_Existentialism_ highlights that _authenticity_ is achieved through a continuous process of _self-discovery_ and _personal evolution_. In this light, **Azrael** is not just a static symbol but a dynamic representation of ongoing growth and transformation. It reflects a dedication to exploring and understanding the depths of one's own existence and the world at large, constantly evolving and adapting in the pursuit of a genuine and meaningful life.

While **Azrael** represents a deeply personal choice, it also resonates with universal themes of life, death, and the _human experience_. This interplay between individuality and universality is a cornerstone of _existential thought_. The personal journey mirrored in the name **Azrael** highlights the _universal quest_ for understanding, purpose, and connection in a world that is often complex and challenging.

Naming myself **Azrael** is more than a symbolic gesture; it is a profound commitment to a life lived with _depth_, _authenticity_, and an open embrace of _existential realities_. It signifies a journey that is constantly evolving, reflecting both the personal nuances of individual existence and the broader _human condition_. This choice is a testament to the courage to confront life's greatest questions and the determination to find _meaning_ and _purpose_ within them.
